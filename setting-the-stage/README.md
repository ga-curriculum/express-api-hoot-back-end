**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand the architecture and functional requirements of building a secure Express API for a blogging application, including user authentication and CRUD operations for blog posts and comments.

## Overview

In this module, we'll build an Express API that serves as the back-end for a full-stack blogging application called **Hoot**.

Within our Express API, we'll implement full CRUD functionality on a blog post resource `hoots`. Additionally, we will implement `create` functionality on an embedded resource called `comments`.

Our Express API will make use of the [Express API JWT Auth Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/express-api-jwt-auth-template.git). This template provides our Express application with pre configured JWT Authentication. This style of authentication in HTTP uses tokens, or unique identifier strings, to tell who a user is when they're making an authenticated request.

Thanks to this template, our Express application will already be able to **sign up** and **sign in** users. The template also includes a `verifyToken` middleware function. The `verifyToken` middleware ensures that any route following it in the middleware pipeline will require authentication before proceeding.

To demonstrate JWT Authentication, our Express application will use `verifyToken` to _protect_ all routes related to the `hoot` resource. This means users will be required to sign in before getting access to any `hoot` data.

## User Stories

Our Express API should include functionality for the following user stories:

- As a guest, I should be able to create an account.
- As a user with an account, I should be able to log in to my account.
- As a user, I should be able to create a hoot post.
- As a user, I should be able to read a list of all hoots.
- As a user, I should be able to view information about a single hoot post along with its associated comments.
- As a user, I should be able to add a comment to a specific hoot.
- As the author of a hoot, I should be able to update that hoot.
- As the author of a hoot, I should be able to delete that hoot.

User stories related to signing up and signing in have been completed for us in the **Express API JWT Auth Template**, but we will be implementing the remaining features from scratch.

## Express & Postman

Below you can see a chart outlining the RESTful routes required for this application:

| HTTP Method | Controller    | Response | URI                     | Use Case          |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| POST        | create        | 200      | /hoots                  | Create a hoot     |
| GET         | index         | 200      | /hoots                  | List hoots        |
| GET         | show          | 200      | /hoots/:hootId          | Get a single hoot |
| PUT         | update        | 200      | /hoots/:hootId          | Update a hoot     |
| DELETE      | deleteHoot    | 200      | /hoots/:hootId          | Delete a hoot     |
| POST        | createComment | 200      | /hoots/:hootId/comments | Create a comment  |

> ❗ Important: When testing these routes in Postman, make sure to enclose all JSON keys in the data payload (body) with double quotes (`"`). JSON requires keys to be wrapped in double quotes to work correctly.
